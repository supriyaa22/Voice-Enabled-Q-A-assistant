      <h2 class="mb-4">Question Answering</h2>
      <p>Question answering provides cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows one to create a
        natural conversational layer over your data. It is used to find the most appropriate answer for any
        input from one's custom knowledge base (KB) of information.
        Question Answering is the task of answering questions (typically reading comprehension questions),
        but abstaining when presented with a question that cannot be answered based on the provided context.
        Question answering is commonly used to build conversational client applications, which include
        social media applications, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop applications. Several new features have
        been added including enhanced relevance using a deep learning ranker, precise answers, and end-to-end region
        support.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">Text Summarization</h2>
      <p>Text Summarization is an unsupervised learning method of a text span that conveys important information of the
        original text while being significantly shorter. The state-of-the-art methods are
        based on neural networks of different architectures as well as pre-trained language models or word embeddings.
        There is an enormous amount of textual material, and it is only growing every single day.
        Think of the internet, comprised of web pages, news articles, status updates, blogs and so much more. The data
        is unstructured and the best that we can do to navigate it is to use search and skim the results. There is a
        great need to reduce much of this text data to shorter, focused summaries that capture the salient details, both
        so we can navigate it more effectively as well as check whether the larger documents contain the information
        that we are looking for.
